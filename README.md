Lunar Landing Reinforcement Learning
====================================

This repository contains the code for a reinforcement learning project that focuses on landing a lunar module using the OpenAI Gym toolkit environments. The project utilizes a Deep Q Network (DQN) and incorporates various enhancements such as experience replay, mini-batch gradient descent, epsilon-greedy policy, and soft update.

Landing a lunar module is a challenging task that requires precise control. This project addresses the problem using reinforcement learning techniques, specifically a Deep Q Network. The goal is to train an agent that can successfully land the lunar module on the surface with minimal fuel consumption.
